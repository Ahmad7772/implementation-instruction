# Implementation-Instruction
First of all, we should follow the instruction in order.

- Start with the [base](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/implementation-instruction/blob/main/RobotArm/parts/Base.stl) on which I placed the second part [(waist)](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/implementation-instruction/blob/main/RobotArm/parts/Waist.001.stl) on it.
- Then on the top of the waist, I attached the bottom of the [arm1](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/implementation-instruction/blob/main/RobotArm/parts/Arm%2001.stl) to the waist.
- Then I attached the upper of the arm1 to the bottom of the [arm2](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/implementation-instruction/blob/main/RobotArm/parts/Arm%2002.stl)
- Then I attached the [gripper](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/implementation-instruction/blob/main/RobotArm/parts/Gripper.001.stl) on the upper of arm2.
- Finally we get this [assemble](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/implementation-instruction/blob/main/RobotArm/RobotArm.stl).
